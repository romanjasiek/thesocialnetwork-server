# Garden Friends - A social network
## The server side

Very basic Social Network like Twitter or Instagram built with MongoDB, Express, React, Node and Next, created for study and practice purposes.

Used npm packages:

- @ant-design/icons
- antd - https://www.npmjs.com/package/antd
- axios - https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios
- bootstrap - https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap
- moment - https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment
- next - https://www.npmjs.com/package/next
- react
- react-dom
- react-quill - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-quill
- react-render-html - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-render-html
- react-toastify - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify
- socket.io-client - https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-client

At the moment, this project is not intended to be used in "real life", because it needs a lot of improvements like GDPR compability, email verification, direct messages, privacy settings, maybe cookies and many, many more things. Maybe I will continue to work on this someday if I find the time.
